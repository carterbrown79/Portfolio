        <p> I have developed two websites over the course of my first semester in college, the one
            you are reading this essay on and also this other one you can find here. One I used
            Github to create, and for the other I used wordpress.<p>
                <p>Let’s start with Github. Using
            Github to develop my website was definitely a longer and more challenging journey. As
            someone with no coding background, every single aspect of website development was
            completely foreign. The language and methods were different from anything I had ever
            seen. The hardest part of developing through Github was just learning how everything
            works, and how to code with HTML and CSS. After this major roadblock though, it did get
            a lot easier to work with, and I will never forget how to add, commit, and push.<p>
                <p>Working
            with Wordpress was a lot different because I didn’t have to code anymore (yay!), but the
            layout of all of my options was a little weird and took me time to get used to.
            Wordpress is an awesome way to make a website if you don’t know how to code, but if you
            do know how to code, I don’t believe there is a reason to use wordpress over Github.
            With Github you are in control of everything, but with Wordpress, you are constrained by
            what Wordpress lets you do.<p> 
                <p> When designing both websites the process differs quite a
            bit. With Github, you have to use CSS, along with HTML code to style your website how
            you wish, but with Wordpress, you use the tools the site gives you, like how you would
            design a powerpoint presentation. For someone who doesn't code, Wordpress was much more
            intuitive for me to design my website, whereas on Github, if I wanted to make the same
            changes, I would have to look up what code to write to get the same effect.<p>
                <p> If you want
            to create your own website through Github, you must know how to code. If you want it to
            look neat and professional, coding is a necessity. If you want to create a website
            through Wordpress, you don’t have to know how to code, but your options are limited by
            Wordpress, rather than your coding knowledge. Neither method of creating a website will
            do the designing for you though, that is a skill you must develop on your own. Knowledge
            of code will not make your website pretty automatically, you still have to know what
            looks good to a viewer.<p>
                <p> If I could improve my websites in any way as of 11/5/2025, I
            would definitely like to make them look less ugly. I’m not very good at changing how my
            pages look so I would like to improve at that. I would also like to be better at graphic
            design, because even once I learn how to change the appearance of my websites, I’m not
            confident my changes would be pretty.<p>
                <p>In conclusion, if you know how to code, or want to
            learn how to code, making a website on Github is very doable, and is generally beginner
            friendly if you put a little bit of time into it. If you want to skip coding and all of
            that though, Wordpress is a good alternative, but there are more limitations. </p>
