        <p>Hello world, I am Carter Brown, at the time of writing this I'm a college freshman at Penn State Behrend. 
            This website will be my plattform to highlight everything revolving around me.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure how long I will update this website, the goal is to reflect the kind of person I am 
            (or was depending on when you're reading this) in the time of creating this website for others to view the history of Carter Brown.</p>
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Alien cats are taking over, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>bleep</li>
            <li>blorp</li>
            <li>glorp</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>
