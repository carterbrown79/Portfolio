        <p>Hello world, I am Carter Brown, at the time of writing this I'm a college freshman at Penn State Behrend. 
            This website will be my plattform to highlight everything revolving around me.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure how long I will update this website, the goal is to reflect the kind of person I am 
            (or was depending on when you're reading this) in the time of creating this website for others to view the history of Carter Brown.</p>
